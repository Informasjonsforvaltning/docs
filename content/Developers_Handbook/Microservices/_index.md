We base our understanding of what a microservice is on the following definitions:

> *__Microservices__ are small, autonomous services that work together.*

> *__Services__ are out-of-process components who communicate with a mechanism such as a web service request, or remote procedure call.*

> *A __component__ is a unit of software that is independently replaceable and upgradeable.*
