Test coverage numbers are not the goal in itself. What is important to monitor is whether or not a pull request increases or decreases coverage. In most all cases a pull request should maintain or increase coverage. In extreme cases (e.g. when fixing a critical bug), it might be necessary to temporarily sacrifice coverage.
