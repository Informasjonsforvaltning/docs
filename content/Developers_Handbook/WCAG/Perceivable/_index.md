# WCAG Principle 1: Perceivable
*"Perceivable information and user interface"*

### `aria-required`
Attribute used to indicate that user input is required on the element before a form may be submitted.

`aria-required` should only be used where HTML attribute `required` is not applicable.
I.e. `required` should be used in `<input>`, `<select>` and `<textarea>`

### `aria-invalid`
Attribute that indicates the entered value is invalid.
