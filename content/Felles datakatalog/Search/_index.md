There are 3 different ways to search for data in Data.norge.no, each is based on a different technology.

### Search

The main search service in Data.norge.no is based on ElasticSearch. This service searches the text in a limited selection of fields, and has filters and other advanced functionality that helps users navigate.

### LLM

The LLM search service uses a 'Large Language Model' (LLM) that is built from the same data used in the main search, but will accept naturally worded queries where the other search demands exact wording of titles or keywords.

### SPARQL

The SPARQL search service is based on the RDF query language SPARQL, and is our most advanced and powerful search. A user will have to create queries that follows the correct syntax, but will be able to search all harvested data points, not just pre-selected fields.
